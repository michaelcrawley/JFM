\begin{abstract}
This work aims to study the dynamics and noise generated by the large-scale structures in a Mach 0.9 turbulent (Reynolds number of $6.2 \times 10^5$) jet using plasma-based excitation of shear layer instabilities to produce either individual or periodic coherent ring vortices in the shear layer.
First, two-point cross-correlations are used between the acoustic near-field and far-field in order to identify the dominant noise source region.
The large-scale structure interactions are then investigated by stochastically-estimating the time-resolved velocity fields from time-resolved near-field pressure traces and non-time-resolved planar velocity snapshots using an artificial neural network.
Time-resolved velocity fields showed, for the first time, multiple merging of large-scale structures in the shear layer of such a high Reynolds number, high speed jet.
Finally, from the estimated time-resolved velocity the aeroacoustic source terms were computed using Ribner's dilatation-based acoustic analogy.
The results indicated that the disintegration of the coherent ring vortices are the dominant aeroacoustic source mechanism for the jet studied here. 
However, the merging of vortices in the initial shear layer was also identified as a non-trivial noise source mechanism.
