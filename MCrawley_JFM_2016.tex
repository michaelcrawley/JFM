\begin{abstract}
This work aims to study the dynamics of, and noise generated by, the large-scale structures in high-fidelity in a Mach 0.9 turbulent jet using plasma-based excitation to produce either individual or periodic coherent ring vortices in the shear layer.
First, two-point cross-correlations are used between the acoustic near-field and far-field in order to identify the dominant noise source region.
The large-scale structure interactions are then investigated by stochastically-estimating the time-resolved velocity fields from time-resolved near-field pressure traces and non-time-resolved planar velocity snapshots using an artificial neural network.
Finally, from the estimated time-resolved velocity the aeroacoustic source terms were computed using Ribner's dilatation-based acoustic analogy.
The results indicated that the disintegration of the coherent ring vortices are the dominant aeroacoustic source mechanism for the jet studied here. 
However, the merging of vortices in the initial shear layer was also identified as a non-trivial noise source mechanism.
