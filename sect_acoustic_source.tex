\section{The Aeroacoustic Source Field}
\label{sect:source}
Ribner presented an alternative approach to Lighthill's acoustic analogy which posited fluctuating fluid dilatations as the source of aeroacoustic emission \citep{Ribner1962}.
This is a reinterpretation of Lighthill's source, which in subsonic, unheated, turbulent jets consists of fluctuating momentum flux.
The driving factor behind Ribner's analysis is the conceptual simplification of the aeroacoustic sources: Lighthill's quadrupoles are replaced by the contraction or expansion of fluid elements (confusingly identified alternatively as \emph{pseudosound} or \emph{pseudo-pressure}) due to the fluctuating momentum flux, which in turn drive the acoustic field.
This conceptual simplicity makes the dilatation-based approach to the acoustic analogy particularly attractive to the experimentalist for high-speed (though subsonic), turbulent flows.
The analysis, described briefly in the subsequent section, is simple to perform computationally, relying exclusively on second-order derivatives (unlike the third-order differential equation derived by \citet{Lilley2003}) which include a natural filtering mechanism.
More importantly, the pseudosound field (which is the direct precursor to the source field) can be directly compared against the time-resolved hydrodynamic pressure field measured in the irrotational near-field, thus serving as a helpful validation of the computations.

Ribner's analysis follows directly from Lighthill's; the source term is first reduced by neglecting viscosity and entropic fluctuations (thereby assuming that the flow is of high Reynolds number and unheated), leaving only the Reynolds stress terms:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 p = \nabla \cdot \nabla \cdot \rho \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}.
\end{equation}
Ribner then split the pressure fluctuations into an acoustic component and an incompressible component (pseudosound, which is associated with the convective hydrodynamic fluctuations), $p' + p_0 = p_a + p_s$. 
The incompressible component of the flow will then satisfy
\begin{equation}
	 \rho \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} )  = 0
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{v}$ is now used in place of $\mathbf{u}$ to signify an incompressible (solenoidal) velocity field. 
Therefore, 
\begin{equation}
	- \nabla^2 p_s = \nabla \cdot \nabla \cdot \rho_0 \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{v}.
	\label{eq:solenoidal_pressure}
\end{equation}
Ribner's analysis then assumes that the full density and velocity fields can be approximated as the incompressible (solenoidal) fields (the higher-order terms scaling with the fluctuating Mach number, thus producing Ribner's dilatation equation:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 p_a}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 p_a = -\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 p_s}{\partial t^2}.
	\label{eq:ribner_source}
\end{equation} 
In this way, acoustic pressure field is ultimately linked to the time rate of change of the dilatation (see \citet{Ristorcelli1997} for a very enlightening perturbation analysis which makes this relationship far more clear).
Numerous researchers have used the dilatation field to examine the aeroacoustic phenomena (primarily using DNS or LES simulations); see \citet{Mitchell1995}, \citet{Colonius1997}, or \citet{Freund2000} for examples.

\subsection{Numerical Methodology}
Computing the aeroacoustic source per Ribner's dilatation method from the estimated, time-resolved velocity field constitutes a three-step process. 
First, the solenoidal velocity field is computed via the Helmholtz' decomposition; the double divergence of the resulting stress tensor is then used as the source of Poisson's equation to calculate the pseudo-pressure field. 
Finally, the pseudo-pressure field is filtered in time using an energy threshold in the wavelet domain, and the second time derivative of the resultant field is computed, producing the source field.
This process is outlined in the following sections.
\subsubsection{Helmholtz Decomposition}
For a given vector field, $\mathbf{F}$, Helmholtz's theorem states that any sufficiently smooth vector field can be linearly decomposed into irrotational and solenoidal vector fields, as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}_{potential} + \mathbf{F}_{rotational} = \nabla \Phi + \nabla \times \Psi
\end{equation}
where $\Phi$ is a scalar field and $\Psi$ is a vector field.
From basic vector calculus properties, one can therefore compute these solenoidal and irrotational components by taking the divergence of this equation, leading to:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \nabla^{2} \Phi
\end{equation}
which is simply Poisson's equation, where in the context of a velocity decomposition the forcing term is simply the divergence of the flow field (that is, the dilatation).

As only planar, not volumetric, PIV measurements were available, the azimuthal velocity and derivative terms are unknown and thus were be neglected from this analysis.
As mentioned previously, the flow-field in a natural, high Reynolds number jet is a combination of numerous azimuthal Fourier modes.
Though the velocity field has been found to contain a significant amount of energy at the higher order modes, the axisymmetric mode is still the dominant mode within the potential core region of the jet \citep{Glauser1987}.
Additionally, it is the acoustic emission from the coherent large-scale toroidal structure generated by excitation that is the primary focus of this endeavor, not the full acoustic emission from the relatively incoherent natural turbulence.
Due to the specific nature of the excitation (axisymmetric excitation), the azimuthal components of the flow are not expected to be significant.

The database of \citet{Speth2014} was provided to the authors for the purpose of validating this assumption.
Comparisons between the near-field pressure response to excitation of the experimental and numerical databases were performed in the reference, and a good match was found.
Sample results for the pressure and radial velocity field for a single azimuthal plane are shown in \fig{fig:LES_streamwise_phavg}; these results correspond to an actuation phase of $1.4 \pi$ for $St_{DF} = 0.05$, and have been phase-averaged over nine actuation cycles.
From these plots, a large-scale coherent structure generated by the excitation can easily be identified, centered at $x/D = 2.1, r/D = 0.5$.

\end{figure}

Though the azimuthal velocity is, unsurprisingly, non-zero, the field is highly incoherent as compared to the radial or axial velocity fields and of much lower amplitude.
The dilatation field computed using the full 3-D gradients and the partial dilatation field computed using only the radial and axial gradients can be found in \fig{fig:LES_streamwise_dil}.
Because there are weak azimuthal structures inherent even in the excited turbulent jet, a noticeable difference between the two- and full three-component dilatation fields is readily apparent in terms of fluctuation amplitude.
However, the spatial structure of the full dilatation field is largely retained in the reduced (two-component) dilatation field, just at an amplitude reduced by a nearly constant factor of $\sim 2$.
Because of this, the loss of the azimuthal gradient information is not expected to be produce unacceptable errors in the final solution.

\end{figure}
 
The Helmholtz equation was solved using a standard, second-order accurate centered finite difference scheme by Taylor approximation (as will all subsequent differential equations).
A relatively low-order approximation to the spatial derivatives was deemed sufficient for this particular work, as the spatial grid was very fine compared to the wavelength of the dominant structures under investigation.
For reference, $l/ds \simeq 30$, where $l$ is the average characteristic length of the excited large-scale structures near the end of the potential core and $ds$ is the grid spacing ($ds = 0.6$ mm).
As the flow has already been assumed to be axisymmetric, only the top half-plane of the jet was used.
At the lower boundary (jet centerline), a zero-normal-gradient boundary condition was used to enforce axisymmetry.
At the radial boundary, the solenoidal component was set to zero (as there is no turbulent flow in this region, and the only outgoing waves will be compressible).
At the inflow and outflow however, the proper boundary conditions are not immediately obvious.
Other researchers using numerical databases \citep{Unnikrishnan2015} have argued that the solenoidal component be set to zero here as the turbulent eddies have either not grown to significant values or decay to insignificant values at these locations, respectively.
For the domain explored in the current work however, this does not appear to be necessarily accurate, and instead the \textit{potential} component was set to zero at both the inlet and outlet.
At the outflow boundary ($x/D \simeq 13$), there is still significant vortical behavior, but the Mach number is relatively low ($M_j \simeq 0.5$) and hence compressibility is expected to be negligible.
At the inflow boundary (which is $\sim1.4$ mm downstream of the nozzle exit), the solenoidal component is clearly non-negligible in the shear layer region (since $\partial U_x / \partial r \neq 0$).
If the inflow is approximated as a plug flow, $\partial U_x / \partial x = \partial U_r / \partial r = 0$ and hence the potential component is negligible there.
Therefore, the potential component was set to zero at both the inlet and outlet.
Second-order accurate centered finite differences were again used to approximate the derivatives in the boundary conditions; a single ghost node was used along each boundary to enforce these conditions.

Sample results from the experimental database for this procedure have been provided in \fig{fig:valid_helmholtz}.
Here, the axial and radial velocity components for the original (estimated) and decomposed velocity fields are shown for $St_{DF}=0.05$.
From the raw velocity field, a single large-scale structure is readily identifiable at $x/D \simeq 6$ (which is the end of the potential core).
Due to the very low frequency of the excitation (impulsive forcing), no other large-scale structures are clearly visible in the flow-field.
As expected, the Helmholtz decomposition produces a solenoidal velocity that is quite similar to the full velocity field; even at high subsonic Mach numbers, compressibility plays a minor (though non-negligible) role in the overall evolution of the shear layer and potential core.
The upstream development of the potential field, in which no large-amplitude oscillations are observed, validates the assumption of plug flow made in the boundary conditions.
In contrast, non-negligible fluctuations are observed near the outflow boundary; unfortunately, the experimental domain does not extend far enough downstream for the compressible component to fully decay.
However, the potential component is still far weaker than the solenoidal component.
For validation purposes, the boundary conditions of \citet{Unnikrishnan2015} (zero solenoidal component at the inflow and outflow) were also implemented and compared against the current results.
Though not shown here for brevity, the zero-solenoidal boundary conditions produced similar fields at the interior of the domain, but non-physical oscillations at the inflow and outflow boundaries.
Based on these results, the zero-potential boundary conditions were retained.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Pseudo-Pressure Solver}
Once the solenoidal velocity field is known, the fluctuating pseudo-sound field can be computed as the incompressible solution to the momentum and continuity equations, and the source field is calculated explicitly from the solution of the Helmholtz decomposition.
As with the preceding Poisson equation, the azimuthal terms in this second Poisson equation are assumed negligible in comparison to the radial and axial terms and are thus ignored.
As done previously for the Helmholtz decomposition, the governing equation is approximated using second-order accurate centered finite differences, and ghost nodes are used at the domain boundaries to enforce the boundary conditions.

The hydrodynamic pressure field has been observed to strongly decay with radial position \citep{Arndt1997}; given the radial extent of the experimental domain, it was therefore assumed that the pseudo-sound fluctuations have decayed to negligible values by the time they reach the upper domain boundary.
In accordance with the boundary assumptions made in the preceding section, at the inflow boundary plug flow has again been assumed, meaning that the pseudo-pressure \textit{fluctuations} are negligible at the inlet. 
The outflow boundary was assumed to be far enough downstream such that the fluctuations were also negligible at the boundary.
Finally, the lower boundary enforced the zero-normal-gradient required by the assumption of axisymmetry.

Sample results for the pseudo-pressure field are shown in \fig{fig:valid_pseudopressure}, which corresponds to the solenoidal velocity decomposed in \fig{fig:valid_helmholtz}.
As expected, a spatially-coherent fluctuation is observed coinciding with the location of the large-scale structure as identified in the velocity field.
Lower-amplitude oscillations are also observed upstream of the end of the potential core, while downstream the fluctuations are fairly incoherent and low-amplitude.
By the end of the experimental domain, the pseudo-pressure field has decayed to essentially negligible values.
At the inlet however, a large-amplitude pressure sink resides along the jet lipline and extends for $x/D \lesssim 0.5$.
The origin of this pressure sink is not clear to the researcher, however it is entirely numerical in nature; as will be seen in the following section, the consistency of this sink results in no superfluous aeroacoustic source being computed for this location.
While the presence of this numerical error is unfortunate, given that it was not found to have a major effect on the computed aeroacoustic source field (which is ultimately the goal of this analysis), further inquiry into the cause of this numerical error was deemed unproductive.

	\caption{Instantaneous pseudo-pressure field for the same conditions as \fig{fig:valid_helmholtz}.}
	\label{fig:valid_pseudopressure}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Aeroacoustic Source}
The aeroacoustic source term can now be computed explicitly as the second temporal derivative of the pseudo-sound field (\eq{eq:ribner_source}).
However, filtering of the pseudo-pressure field along the temporal dimension was found to be necessary before computation of the derivative, due to the accumulation of experimental and numerical error.
Wavelet-based denoising was chosen to remove the influence of the experimental/numerical errors; an energy threshold was applied to the orthogonal wavelet coefficients in order to remove the less-energetic, incoherent events from the pseudo-pressure field.
The mother wavelet was defined as the $5^{th}$-order Battle-Lemarie wavelet; sample data was also analyzed using other smooth wavelets to ensure that the final results were not affected by the choice of mother wavelet.
A threshold of $\epsilon = 8 \sigma_n \sqrt{ \mathrm{log}_e N}$ was used; this value was found by trial-and-error to be the lowest threshold which consistently removed all discontinuities in the temporal derivative of the pressure trace.
To compute the far-field noise, the filtered source field can be spatially-integrated in retarded time, accounting for the propagation delay from each source location to the observer, per the well-known Green's function solution to the wave equation \citep{Crighton1992}.

	\label{fig:valid_source}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Wavepackets in the Pseudo-Pressure Field}
The signature of the large-scale structures in the irrotational near-field pressure has been well-known for some time.
As discussed in \sect{sect:nearfield}, the near-field pressure response to a large-scale structure takes the form of a compact wave which is modulated in amplitude and spatial extent as it convects through the jet shear layer; the near-field response to excitation-induced large-scale structures is discussed in more detail by \citet{Sinha2012}.
Similar results have also been found by \citet{Tinney2008} in a natural, subsonic jet.
Per Ribner's analysis, these near-field pressure signatures are related to the noise sources and hence can serve as a useful validation of the computed pseudo-pressure fields since they are close physical analogues (though the hydrodynamic component of the irrotational near-field pressure isn't strictly incompressible, compressibility effects are minor). 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/sect_aeroacoustic_wvpkt_validation.png}
	\caption{Comparison of wavepackets measured from the hydrodynamic component of the irrotational near-field (a,c) against those in the computed pseudo-pressure field (b,d) for $St_{DF} = 0.05$ (a,b) and $St_{DF} = 0.25$ (c,d). A constant intensity map of $\pm 500$ Pa was used for all plots, and the experimentally measured near-field pressure was acquired \textbf{separately} from the velocity fields used to compute the pseudo-pressure.}
	\label{fig:flowfield_wvpkts}
\end{figure}

In \fig{fig:flowfield_wvpkts} the hydrodynamic component of the irrotational near-field pressure as measured directly by the linear microphone array is compared against the pseudo-pressure field computed from the estimated time-resolved velocity fields for two excitation frequencies. 
The `probe' locations in the pseudo-pressure field were chosen to mimic those of the near-field microphone array (just outside the shear layer and inclined $8.6^\circ$ with respect to the jet axis), just at a much higher spatial resolution.

As expected, a clear wavepacket response is observed in the pseudo-pressure fields at the excitation frequency, similar to the behavior found in the hydrodynamic near-field pressure (note that the poor spatial resolution of the near-field microphones is producing an aliasing error for $St_{DF}=0.25$).
For both fields and excitation frequencies, the wavepackets are the strongest and most coherent upstream of the end of the potential core.
Downstream of the potential core, the flow is far more disorderly, as some of the LAFPA-induced structures have broken down completely while others have not - this is most readily observed for $St_{DF}=0.05$ where more than a few LAFPA-induced structures persist weakly far downstream.
Surprisingly, the amplitude of the pseudo-pressure response is quite similar to that of the measured near-field pressure response.

The pseudo-pressure field does unfortunately exhibit a worse match against the measured near-field pressure in the far-downstream region; the cause for this is two-fold.
First, since the pressure field is highly damped with radial distance and wavenumber \citep{Arndt1997}, estimating turbulent fluctuations near the jet centerline becomes increasingly difficult as the microphones move further away due to the spreading of the shear layer; the velocity information just simply isn't present in the near-field pressure fluctuations.
Second, as the structures begin to breakdown near the end of the potential core, they lose their axisymmetry.
This presents additional difficulties for the stochastic estimation, since the near-field microphones are offset azimuthally from the PIV laser sheet a vortex captured in the streamwise slice of the flow-field is not
necessarily azimuthally-coherent and hence may not be captured by the microphones.
Given the results of \sect{sect:nearfield} as well as \citet{Hileman2005}, which found the dominant source region to be located near the end of the potential core, rather than two potential core lengths downstream, this discrepancy between the measured and computed pressure fields, though unfortunate, is not expected to effect the final results or interpretation thereof.  

\subsection{Accuracy of the Acoustic Far-field}
As will be shown in the following section, the energy of the hydrodynamic field (pseudo-pressure) is orders of magnitude greater than the acoustic field.
Hence, even slight experimental errors in the source field can overwhelm the computations for the acoustic field, rendering them next to meaningless for far-field predictions.
This problem is not unique to Ribner's or Lighthill's approaches to the acoustic analogy; it plagues vortex sound theories as well \citep{Bridges1992}.
In Ribner's dilatation acoustic analogy the source field takes the form of quadrupoles \citep{Ristorcelli1997}; the delicate interplay of these sources and sinks determining the acoustic far-field at a given spatial and temporal position.

For reference, the computed acoustic signal at a far-field observer position matching the experimental far-field array ($R = 2.57$~m from the nozzle exit, at $\phi = 30^\circ$) has been plotted against the measured signal in \fig{fig:ch5_farfield}.
For simplicity, the signals have been phase-averaged and only a single excitation period is shown.
A coherent fluctuation could conceivably be observed in the acoustic field of the impulsively-excited jet (\fig{fig:ch5_farfield}a) centered around $\tau \simeq 0.8$, however given the lack of quiet time expected in the signal this could just as easily be wishful thinking.
An offset in the time-of-arrival for the coherent wave between the calculated and measured signals could be due simply to an error in the positioning of the microphone relative to the nozzle exit, though given the poor match regardless of time-of-arrival, investigating this was deemed nonessential.
Similarly, the computed acoustic signal for the periodic excitation cases ($St_{DF} = 0.25$$ and $$0.35$) bears only vague similarities in shape and amplitude to the measured signal.
Ultimately this means of course, that the computed source field should be viewed with some level of reservation, and hence will only be analyzed in the broadest of terms.

\section{Aeroacoustic Behavior of Coherent Structures}
The pseudo-pressure field induced by the coherent vortex takes the form of a spatially-modulated traveling wave; this can be observed in \fig{fig:PSL_St005}.
A strong expansion wave is found to be centered on the vortex, preceded by an equally strong compression wave.
As the vortex convects downstream and amplifies, the radial extent of the pressure fluctuation amplifies as well; initially the pressure fluctuation is concentrated only around the jet lipline but by $x/D \simeq 2$ the pressure fluctuations reach all the way to the jet centerline.
These pressure fluctuations induce secondary, weaker fluctuations both precede and follow the dominant pair as they convect downstream.
The strength of this traveling wave is directly proportional to the strength of the vortex, as the vortices begin to break down near $x/D = 4$, the pseudo-pressure fluctuations decay rapidly as well. 
A similar behavior is observed for the periodically-excited jets ($St_{DF} = 0.25$ is shown in \fig{fig:PSL_St025}), though the pseudo-pressure field now of course takes the form of a periodic train of convecting vortices and modulating waves.
Compared to the impulse-excitation case, the radial extent of the pressure fluctuations in the periodic-excitation cases grows much more rapidly.

\end{figure}

It should come as no surprise then that the aeroacoustic source would take the form of a wavepacket, centered around the coherent vortex.
This is shown in \fig{fig:SL} for both the impulsively- and periodically-excited structures.
Owing to the rapid growth and pairing process, the source field for the periodically-excited structures quickly amplifies and saturates by $x/D \simeq 2$.
In contrast, a slow amplification is observed for the impulsive structure, which reaches its maximum amplitude just before the vortex begins to decay. 
Based on the temporal extent of the acoustic response in the far-field, the acoustic wavelength of the emission produced by the individual ring vortex is $\sim 11D$, which would mean that the sources are non-compact per the results of \fig{fig:SL}a.
This is in general agreement with the analysis of \citet{Michalke1972}, which showed that the experimentally observed far-field spectral directivity could be reproduced using an axially-coherent, noncompact source model.
Of course, the amplitude of the source term alone does not determine acoustic emission; the acoustic emission is essentially the linear summation of the source/sink pairs (evaluated at retarded time) generated by the evolution of the vortices - a high amplitude source field coexisting with zero acoustic emission at a particular instant in time is therefore possible.
A rapid truncation of the source term therefore has the potential to significantly amplify the acoustic emission.

	\label{fig:SL}
\end{figure}

This issue was explored in depth by \citet{Cavalieri2010} using analytic models for subsonic wavepackets.
By allowing the wavepacket amplitude and spatial extent to vary in time (termed `jittering'), the superdirective, intermittent acoustic emission pattern observed in high-speed jets was recovered and the predicted amplitude was within 1.5 dB of the measured.
A similar modulation of the spatial extent and amplitude of the source wavepackets can be observed here, depicted in \fig{fig:jittering}.
For the impulsively-excited jet, a single dominant acoustic source region is observed, modulated in space and time per the passage of the large-scale structures, and located at $ 2 \lesssim x/D \lesssim 6$.
As discussed previously, corresponds to the disintegration of the large-scale coherent vortices as they begin to self-interact near the end of the potential core.
For the $St_{DF} = 0.25$ excitation case, the overall amplitude of the acoustic source field is much higher than for the impulsively-excited case.
However, a similar modulation of the amplitude and spatial extent is observed here.
Unlike the impulsively-excited case however, the periodically-excited jet has, in addition to the downstream acoustic source, a high-intensity source region  for $x/D \lesssim 2$, corresponding to the pairing of the multiple harmonic structures generated per excitation pulse.
That the significant amplification of the fluctuating Reynolds' stress produced by the vortex merging is amplifying the source field, is unsurprising.
For this excitation frequency, the results of \sect{sect:nearfield} indicate that this is ultimately failing to significantly affect the far-field acoustic emission, at least at low polar angles.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/sect_acoustic_source_modulated_source.png}

	\label{fig:jittering}

As the excitation frequency is further increased to $St_{DF} = 0.35$ however, the relative importance of the aeroacoustic source associated with the vortex merging is significantly increased.
The source field in the $St_{DF} = 0.35$ exhibits two highly distinctive regions in which the waveform undergoes a rapid modulation; this is in contrast to the results for $St_{DF} = 0.25$, where the source associated with the vortex merging and the source associated with the structure disintegration appear combined.
Vortex merging has been experimentally identified as acoustically important in low-speed, low-Reynolds number jets \citep{Kibens1980}.
The results of this section indicate that, under the right circumstances, vortex merging might also play a non-negligible role in the noise generation process in high-speed turbulent jets.
